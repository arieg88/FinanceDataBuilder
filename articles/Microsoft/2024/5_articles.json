        "Author": "  Matt Day ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s newly named cloud chief, Matt Garman, inherits a $100-billion-a-year business that’s as profitable as it has ever been. He also faces the daunting task of retaining the cloud-computing pioneer’s edge in the artificial intelligence age.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIran State TV Says ‘No Sign of Life’ at Helicopter Crash Site\nEbrahim Raisi, Iranian President Confronting West, Dies at 63\nSpeedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge\nSaudi Crown Prince Postpones Japan Trip Over King’s Health\nChina’s Housing Rescue Too Small to End Crisis, Analysts Say\nA longtime Amazon Web Services engineering leader who was most recently sales chief, Garman, 48, will assume one of the most prominent positions in the technology industry when he succeeds Adam Selipsky next month.\nSelipsky, who has led AWS since 2021, will relinquish the role on June 3 “to move onto his next challenge,” Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in an email to employees on Tuesday.\nThe cloud unit, the world’s largest seller of rented computing power and data storage, has long accounted for most of Amazon’s operating income, serving as a cash machine that gives the parent company flexibility to make big investments in other areas.\nBut AWS struggled in the last two years when businesses trimmed their technology spending following pandemic-era splurges. The cloud unit’s growth slowed to a record low last year, which executives attributed in part to Amazon’s own efforts to help customers save money. The unit held its largest-ever layoffs a year ago and has continued trimming since, even as it continues to hire for specific areas.\nThe division also stumbled out of the gate in the race to commercialize a new generation of artificial intelligence services, lagging behind rivals Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in bringing to market the systems that power such products as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\nEarly versions of AWS’s AI products were deemed insufficient by some customers. Since then, the company has invested $4 billion in Anthropic, a well-regarded builder of generative AI tools. AWS is also building its own tools to rival ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power AI services with its servers.\nSo while Microsoft and Google are widely seen as leaders in generative AI — which responds to users’ prompts with newly created text, voice or images — Amazon expects to reap tens of billions of dollars in AI-related business for years to come.\n“Regardless of how much or how little Adam Selipsky is responsible for AWS’s progression in AI, as CEO, he owns the outcome,” said Corey Quinn, the chief cloud economist at the Duckbill Group, a consulting firm that advises AWS clients. “And the outcome has not been terrific.”\nSelipsky, 57, said in a note to employees that he would “take the opportunity to spend more time with family for a while, recharge a bit, and create some mental free space to reflect and consider the possibilities.” A spokesperson for AWS declined to comment beyond the executives’ memos.\nSelipsky was Jassy’s right hand during the cloud group’s early years, serving in a chief operating officer-like capacity that saw him lead sales, marketing and other roles. He left in 2016 to run Tableau, a Seattle builder of data visualization tools later sold to Salesforce Inc., before returning three years ago. His second stint at Amazon was a surprise to many AWS employees who had expected the job to go to Garman.\nGarman interned at Amazon in 2005 while still in business school at Northwestern University, and joined full-time the following year, helping to launch some of the first AWS products. He went on to run engineering teams working on Amazon’s on-demand computing power services, and began leading AWS’s sales and marketing teams in 2020, a sign to close watchers of the company that he was being groomed for the top job.\nPracticed Humility\nPeople who’ve worked with Garman describe him as a detail-oriented engineering manager in the Amazon mold, brimming with self-confidence and a practiced humility when dealing with customers or entering new markets. Like many of Amazon’s senior executives, he’s not considered a polished public speaker or gladhander. Garman doesn’t shy away from confrontation, challenging the assumptions of product teams in meetings and drilling down on specific data points.\n“Matt has an unusually strong set of skills and experiences for his new role,” said Jassy, who led AWS from its inception in the early 2000s until he was named to Amazon’s top job in 2021. “He’s very customer focused, a terrific product leader, inventive, a clever problem-solver, right a lot, has high standards and meaningful bias for action.”\nGarman said he’ll announce organizational changes in the coming weeks. One arrived on Tuesday: Amazon’s sustainability teams, which had reported to Selipsky, will move to communications chief Drew Herdener’s organization.\nShortly after he started at AWS, Garman was asked by a business school pal who worked in another Amazon unit how things were going at AWS, which at the time was a counterintuitive bet by an online retailer. Garman replied that he thought AWS would someday be a $1 billion business. His friend scoffed, Garman told Bloomberg in 2019.\nBy the time AWS publicly disclosed its sales almost a decade after that conversation, AWS was on track for almost $8 billion in annual sales.\n“We thought it would take a lot longer,” Garman said.\n(Updates with background throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "Title": "A Look At The Fair Value Of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Microsoft fair value estimate is US$434\nMicrosoft's US$425 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\nOur fair value estimate is 9.2% lower than Microsoft's analyst price target of US$478\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$69.4b\nUS$78.7b\nUS$95.7b\nUS$115.1b\nUS$139.2b\nUS$157.2b\nUS$172.5b\nUS$185.5b\nUS$196.5b\nUS$206.2b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x23\nAnalyst x25\nAnalyst x14\nAnalyst x6\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 12.89%\nEst @ 9.73%\nEst @ 7.53%\nEst @ 5.98%\nEst @ 4.90%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% \nUS$64.8k\nUS$68.7k\nUS$78.1k\nUS$87.7k\nUS$99.1k\nUS$104.5k\nUS$107.2k\nUS$107.7k\nUS$106.6k\nUS$104.5k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$929b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$206b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.4%) = US$4.5t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.5t÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$2.3t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.2t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$425, the company appears about fair value at a 2.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.012. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Bill Gates made a name for himself -- and established his vast fortune -- as the co-founder and CEO of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The company is best known for developing its ubiquitous Windows operating system (OS), Internet Explorer, and Office suite of productivity software.\nMore recently, Microsoft has expanded its portfolio to include Azure cloud, the Teams workplace platform, Surface laptop and notebook computers, and Xbox gaming consoles, among others.\nAs the former CEO, it isn't surprising that so much of Gates' fortune is still tied up in Microsoft stock. It's easy to see why, aside from it being his former company. Gates has been vocal about the vast potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to change how we live and interact with technology. Microsoft is at the cutting edge of generative AI, developing a suite of Copilots to help streamline tasks and increase worker productivity.\nA survey of early users found that 70% of respondents said Copilot made them more productive, and 77% said they didn't want to stop using it. Furthermore, AI is boosting Microsoft Azure, which has been the fastest-growing cloud infrastructure provider in the calendar fourth quarter, with revenue up 30% year over year. The company said six percentage points of that growth was thanks to AI.\nIn recent years, Gates has turned his attention to philanthropic endeavors, having pledged to eventually donate \"virtually all\" of his wealth to charity. To accomplish that goal, he set up the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which holds a large chunk of his vast fortune.\nGates is estimated to be worth roughly $127 billion, according to Forbes. Regulatory filings reveal that nearly $46 billion of that total is held by the Trust. This includes more than 38 million shares of Microsoft stock, valued at more than $15 billion.\nInvestors could take a lesson from Gates. If he's willing to risk $15 billion on Microsoft stock, it might be worth a look.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "A 2019 email from Microsoft’s CTO to CEO Satya Nadella and Bill Gates shows how spooked the company was by AI rivals Google and OpenAI",
        "Author": "  Paolo Confino ",
        "Text": "In 2019, Microsoft executives at the highest level had an anxious email exchange about AI that would ultimately kick-start its AI investment.\nBack then, chief technology officer Kevin Scott sent a four-page email to CEO Satya Nadella and cofounder Bill Gates with the subject line “thoughts on OpenAI,” which outlined his fears that Microsoft was falling drastically behind in the AI race. At the time, ChatGPT was still more than four years away from being released to the public. But even then, Scott realized OpenAI and Google had made extraordinary steps forward in their work on AI.\n“The thing that’s interesting about what OpenAI and DeepMind and Google Brain are doing is the scale of their ambition,” Scott wrote.\nThe email, which is heavily redacted, came to light as part of the Justice Department’s antitrust investigation into Google and was first reported by Business Insider.\nThat same year, Microsoft would invest $1 billion in OpenAI, the very company Scott cited in his email. Eventually the tech giant would go on to invest at least another $10 billion into the startup, which is credited for popularizing AI chatbots for everyday use with the launch of ChatGPT. The two companies are now intertwined. Microsoft brings its vast resources, the need for which Scott outlines in his email, while OpenAI brings its cutting-edge AI expertise that had so preoccupied the Microsoft executive.\nIn his email, Scott says he miscalculated what exactly Google and OpenAI were trying to accomplish with their AI work. At the time, DeepMind, a startup owned by Google, was trying to build an AI system that could play the Chinese board game Go, which Scott seems to be referencing.\n“I was highly dismissive of that,” Scott wrote. “That was a mistake.”\nScott marveled at how Google and OpenAI had built an entire infrastructure around their AI push. In the email, he said he was surprised Google and OpenAI had designed data centers, sourced silicon chips, and built programming frameworks to enable all their work, according to the email.\n“When they took all of the infrastructure that they had built to build NLP [natural language processing] models that we couldn’t easily replicate, I started to take things more seriously,” Scott told Gates and Nadella.\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe advent of AI has put many of those resources in extremely high demand. AI requires extraordinary amounts of computing power to both run and train the models behind chatbots like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Data centers have become hot properties both as tech investments and as real-estate assets, with some of the biggest investment firms racing to corner the market. Silicon chips, or semiconductors, went through an unprecedented shortage as more and more companies tried to hoard them, fearing they’d run out. Their importance is best exemplified by Nvidia’s legendary stock surge over the past year. AI models also necessitated vast amounts of cloud computing, which companies like Google and Microsoft invested heavily in over the past decade.\nBut back in 2019, when he sent the email, Scott realized how important all these infrastructure upgrades were to developing the sort of AI that’s now commonplace. “As I dug in to try to understand where all of the capability gaps were between Google and us for model training, I got very, very worried,” Scott said.\nScott says at the time that it took Microsoft about six months to train one of its AI models because “our infrastructure wasn’t up to the task.”\nMicrosoft also realized it was lagging its competitors in terms of the personnel it had dedicated toward machine learning and AI research. Since then, employees well-versed in AI have found no shortage of job offers (some with million-dollar pay packages) from companies eager to hire them. The rush to hire AI talent would eventually spread beyond the tech sector to virtually every industry in the corporate world.\nMicrosoft, according to Scott, had some “very smart” machine-learning experts, but they lacked the right resources and headcounts to make a notable dent in deep learning, the complex training mechanism used to develop AI models. That meant their work took longer than it should have, a worrying prospect amid the imminent AI arms race. “We are multiple years behind the competition in terms of [machine learning] scale,” Scott said.\nMeanwhile, Nadella seemed to take Scott’s extensive concerns to heart. Nadella cc’ed chief financial officer Amy Hood and replied: This is “why I want us to do this.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"
