        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ’s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\nWith that said, let’s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American technology company headquartered in California, which is known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related services. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now, with 184 hedge funds holding a stake in the company at the end of Q2 2024, according to Insider Monkey's database.\nThe recently concluded third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was one of the best quarters for the company in a long while, during which it reported a June quarter record revenue of $85.8 billion, up 5% compared to the same period last year. Revenue from products totaled $61.6 billion, representing a 2% year-over-year increase. The growth was aided by the launch of iPad Pro and iPad Air. Services revenue reached an all-time high of $24.2 billion during Q3, up 14% from last year. The company reported a gross margin of 46.3%, which fell within the higher range of guidance for the quarter. EPS was measured at $1.40, beating estimates of $1.35 per share.\nThe company generated $39.3 billion from the sale of iPhones, which accounted for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s overall revenue for the quarter. However, the figure was down 1% year-over-year. This was likely due to a 6.5% drop in sales from Greater China, where the iPhone faces fierce competition from local manufacturers like Huawei. Mac revenue reached $7 billion, up 2% from last year. The biggest success story for the quarter came from iPad, which registered a 24% revenue growth to a total of $7.2 billion.\nWhile the decline in iPhone sales has created some bearish sentiment around the stock, most investors are bullish on the company in anticipation of the incorporation of artificial intelligence in the new iPhone 16. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\nStreet analysts have maintained a consensus Buy rating on the stock and a share price target of $242.41, representing a 5.89% upside from its current trading level.\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n \nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n \nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Retirement portfolios should always include a mix of large-cap stocks (those that are higher value) — often companies with time-tested brands and history — and smaller-cap stocks, which might vary in price.\nWhen it comes to large-cap stocks, look no further than Apple, the electronics leader valued at $3.35 trillion. That’s right — the tech company is worth more than the United Kingdom’s GDP.\nCheck Out: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell\nRead Next: 9 Easy Ways To Build Wealth That Will Last Through Retirement\nDepending on the week, it seems like Apple stock (AAPL) is either trending madly upward or experiencing a worrisome drop as it battles rival companies in China, with investing experts shrieking to “buy, buy, buy” or hold off altogether. For example, in June, Apple secured better profit results than expected, bumping the stock value. However, not long after that, the Oracle of Omaha himself (aka Warren Buffett) shared that Berkshire Hathaway had dumped a significant amount of the stock, which worried investors. It turns out Buffett was just worried about capital gains taxes increasing and wanted to keep his gains and losses in balance.\nRegardless of its ups and downs, even on its worst days, it’s unlikely that Apple will ever lose enough value to become a bad investment. Here are just a few reasons why you should probably include Apple stock in your retirement portfolio.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nIf Apple’s solid historical performance isn’t reason enough to invest in the company, now might be a great time before prices rise again. Some analysts are suggesting that iPhone’s new AI integrations might encourage consumers to upgrade to the iPhone16 in the fall, boosting sales and potential stock price.\nFurthermore, Daniel Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, told Investors Business Daily that as many as 270 million iPhones are overdue for an upgrade.\nLearn More: 8 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024\nFurthermore, while Apple makes its revenue on a steady stream of tried-and-true products people have come to know and love, it’s also constantly innovating. Who remembers the iPod, after all, which revolutionized digital music? And the iPad was among the first tablets to bring streaming entertainment to screens smaller than laptops but bigger than phones. Now that the company is working AI algorithms into more of its programming, everything from iPhones to Apple Watches to MacBooks will stay on the cutting edge of tech evolution, if not outright drive it.\nApple hasn’t stopped at just making technology — once it got a foothold in the streaming entertainment business through Apple TV, it’s gone on to make some incredible, innovative and award-winning unique programming that can’t be found on other platforms. This year alone, Apple TV-produced shows have garnered over 72 Emmy nominations, including limited series like “Lessons in Chemistry” and the ongoing “Slow Horses.”\nMoreover, Apple is known for great customer service via its fishbowl Apple stores, which are equal parts showrooms and IT service centers. This helps to build consumer confidence and keeps Apple at the top of the tech food chain.\nPerhaps in response to slower phone sales, this year Apple also revealed a stock buyback program that is the biggest in company history, buying back $110 billion of stock. This sent its stock price up by 6%, due to trading.\nThere are more reasons than not to keep Apple in your portfolio. Whether its on an upward trend or a downward one now, by the time you retire, you’re likely to reap the benefits of its continued growth.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n7 Reasons A Financial Advisor Could Boost Your Savings in 2024\nFlorida's Retirees Are Fleeing: Experts Predict These 5 States Will Be Top Retirement Spots in 10 Years\n3 Things to Do This Week If You Have Debt\n7 Best New Items To Buy at Big Lots Ahead of Halloween 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Reasons You Should Add Apple Stock to Your Retirement Portfolio\n"

        "Text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has moved back into the top spot as the largest company in the world by market cap. It's gone through some stunning ups and downs, but if you'd bought shares at the initial public offering (IPO) back in 1980 and held on, you'd have a lot more shares, and a lot of money. Let's see just how much.\nApple went public in December 1980 at $22 per share. Like pretty much any stock over a nearly 45-year period, Apple stock has climbed and crashed several times. For example, it lost 21% of its value between 1989 and 1996 -- a long period for an investor to hold on to a stock that's losing. But if you did, you'd have quite a windfall today.\nSince that time, Apple has developed an incredible tech platform with a strong moat in its differentiated systems and applications. It has a strong, loyal fan base that only buys Apple products and consistently moves up to new drops and launches. Just this week Apple released its latest software update, iOS18, with a swarm of new upgrades and features. It's also investing in artificial intelligence (AI) to stay competitive in the tech race.\nThat's why Apple stock has skyrocketed over time and gone through five stock splits: three 2-for-1 stock splits in 1987, 2000, and 2005; a 7-for-1 split in 2014; and a 4-for-1 split in 2020. Each IPO share would have been worth $0.10 split adjusted, and you'd own 224 shares today. At today's prices, that's worth $48,455.\nIn short, the stock has appreciated more than 2,200 times since its IPO. For further perspective, if you had instead invested $1,000 in the stock at its IPO, your investment would've been worth $2.2 million today, excluding the dividends that were paid to you over the years.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "Text": "The Apple(NasdaqGS:AAPL) is currently navigating a complex environment marked by both growth and challenges. Recent developments include a record June quarter revenue of $85.8 billion and significant investments in AI technology, contrasted by a slight decline in iPhone and Wearables revenue and concerns over valuation. In the discussion that follows, we will explore Apple's financial health, key weaknesses, growth opportunities, and external threats to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's current business situation.\nClick here and access our complete analysis report to understand the dynamics of Apple.\nApple's financial health is highlighted by its impressive revenue growth and profitability. The company reported a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from the previous year. This growth was achieved across multiple markets, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Services revenue reached an all-time high of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year, showcasing the strength of Apple's diversified business model. Customer satisfaction remains exceptionally high, with the iPhone 15 family achieving a 98% satisfaction rate in the U.S. Moreover, Apple is trading at 5.3% below its estimated fair value of $240.26, suggesting potential for value appreciation despite a higher Price-To-Earnings Ratio compared to industry peers.To gain deeper insights into Apple's historical performance, explore our detailed analysis of past performance.\nApple faces several challenges. The company's iPhone revenue decreased by 1% year-over-year to $39.3 billion, and revenue from Wearables, Home, and Accessories fell by 2% to $8.1 billion. Additionally, Apple's Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 33.9x is significantly higher than the Global Tech industry average of 21.4x, indicating that it might be overvalued compared to its peers. Gross margin pressure is also a concern, with the products gross margin dropping 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by product mix and partially offset by favorable costs. Furthermore, Apple's earnings growth over the past year (7.6%) did not outperform the Tech industry average of 31.4%.To dive deeper into how Apple's valuation metrics are shaping its market position, check out our detailed analysis of Apple's Valuation.\nApple has several opportunities to enhance its market position and capitalize on emerging trends. The company is making significant investments in Apple Intelligence, aiming to unlock the full potential of AI technology. New product launches, such as the all-new 11- and 13-inch iPad Air, demonstrate Apple's commitment to innovation. Expansion into emerging markets, including the opening of its first location in Malaysia, offers growth potential. Increased engagement in services is also notable, with both transacting and paid accounts reaching new all-time highs, growing double digits year-over-year. These strategic moves are expected to bolster Apple's competitive advantage and drive future growth.\nApple faces several external threats that could impact its long-term success. Currency fluctuations pose a significant risk, with a negative foreign exchange impact of 230 basis points already affecting revenue growth. The competitive environment, particularly in the global tech market, remains intense. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, such as ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Significant insider selling over the past three months also raises concerns about potential internal challenges. These factors highlight the need for Apple to navigate external pressures carefully to sustain its market leadership.\nApple's strong financial health, evidenced by its record revenue and high customer satisfaction, underscores its resilience and potential for value appreciation, especially as it trades 5.3% below its estimated fair value of $240.26. However, challenges such as declining iPhone and Wearables revenue, a higher Price-To-Earnings Ratio, and gross margin pressures indicate areas needing strategic focus. The company's investments in AI, new product launches, and expansion into emerging markets present significant opportunities for future growth. Nonetheless, external threats like currency fluctuations and intense competition necessitate careful navigation to maintain its market leadership and drive sustained success.\nIs Apple part of your asset mix?

        "Title": "Apple Investors Unfazed by Tepid Demand for AI-Powered iPhone",
        "Author": "  Ryan Vlastelica ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- A tepid response from shoppers to the iPhone 16 has not dented investors’ enthusiasm for Apple Inc. shares, which have enjoyed a multi-month rally in anticipation of the launch.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nVanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities\nNJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC\nWhere Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans\nExclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million\nThe model went on sale this month, though the highly touted artificial-intelligence tools won’t arrive as software updates until October. Data on pre-orders and lead times have been cautious, analysts say, suggesting the most optimistic expectations for an upgrade cycle may be out of reach at the moment.\nEven so, Apple stock has managed to dodge the volatility its Big Tech peers have experienced recently, and much of Wall Street still expects the AI iPhones to trigger an acceleration in growth.\nJack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors, is among those betting the upgrade cycle will materialize eventually. While acknowledging the iPhone launch was less strong than hoped, “it won’t even be a speed bump in the company’s long-term progress,” he reckons.\n“Apple has so many cylinders that support the stock, and if one of them trips up in the short term, others can keep going,” Ablin said. “It is a high-quality company with predictable earnings and massive cash flow, and even if it’s a little expensive, it still scans as a safe haven against a macro backdrop that has some question marks.”\nThe shares are up nearly 40% off their April lows, adding $935 billion to the company’s market capitalization. The stock price is just 2% under a record high hit in July, while other megacaps such as Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., and Alphabet Inc., are further away from their all-time peaks.\nShares rose 0.6% on Friday.\nThe view of Apple as a relative haven among equities stems from its track record of steady earnings growth, even during rockier economic periods. It repurchases stock regularly and in large amounts — a buyback announced in May was the largest ever in the US. Finally, it hasn’t engaged in the kind of heavy AI-related capex other megacaps have undertaken; such spending has been increasingly questioned by investors.\nApple screens favorably in terms of quality, profitability, buybacks, and momentum, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Meanwhile, the CBOE Apple VIX, which tracks a market estimate of future volatility for the stock, has been trending lower and is under its 10-year average.\nThe flip side is that it scores poorly on value and growth. Apple trades near 31 times estimated earnings, more than 50% above its 10-year average, and notably above the Nasdaq 100 Index’s multiple of 26. Its price-to-sales ratio recently hit the highest since at least 2000.\nThe growth issue is particularly significant, given the upgrade cycle isn’t playing out yet. Apple’s revenue has dropped in five of the past seven quarters, and analysts predict it will rise just 1.8% in its 2024 fiscal year, before accelerating to 7.9% the following year.\nAll that suggests the stock’s rally could be vulnerable if the hoped-for upgrade cycle doesn’t come through. For such reasons, just two-thirds of analysts recommend buying Apple shares, compared with ratios near or above 90% for Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms Inc.\nAs for the iPhone 16, multiple analysts have flagged early data points, including on pre-orders and lead times, as signs of lower demand.\n“In totality, these data points are more negative than positive for the iPhone 16 cycle, though they still have little predictive power over the full cycle,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.\nBloomberg Intelligence, citing a survey it conducted, as well as daily tracking of iPhone lead times, expects “roughly 230 million iPhone units will be sold in fiscal 2025, for growth of 3%,” below a prior expectation of 5% growth. As a result, analyst Anurag Rana wrote, revenue gains may be 200 basis points below consensus.\nFor Ed Egilinsky, managing director at Direxion Funds, it’s worth waiting to see how demand for the new handset plays out, especially when the AI tools are added.\n“Apple certainly has a great business, and it is one of the premier stocks in the market, but it is priced richly given its growth prospects,” he said. “People need to be aware that just because it’s a bellwether that has been viewed as defensive, it can still face downside.”\nTech Chart of the Day\nMicron Technology Inc. shares soared 15% on Thursday, their biggest one-day percentage gain since December 2011. The rally came after the chipmaker gave a robust forecast, supported by strong demand for artificial intelligence products.\nTop Tech Stories\nArm Holdings Plc approached Intel Corp. about potentially buying the ailing chipmaker’s product division, only to be told that the business isn’t for sale, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.\nDirecTV and Dish are in advanced talks to merge in a deal that would create the largest US pay-TV provider, with almost 20 million subscribers, people familiar with the matter said.\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com Inc. and Meituan enjoyed their best trading days in years after the Chinese government announced measures to stimulate the troubled domestic economy.\nTokyo Electron Ltd. seeks to build a team of chip engineers in India to better ride the Modi government’s push for more semiconductor manufacturing in the world’s most populous country.\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and John Viljoen.\n(Updates to market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nApple Rolls Back Its Big Plans to Release Movies in Theaters\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\nThe End of the Cheap Burger\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft\nHow Harris’ Campaign Finally Made Biden’s Meme Strategy Work\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"
