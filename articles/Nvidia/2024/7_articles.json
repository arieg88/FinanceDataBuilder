        "Text": "Stock splits seem to be all the rage. After years of the step seeing less traction, 2024 already served up a slew of high-profile splits.\nThe biggest, no doubt, was Nvidia, the poster child of the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Some big names joined the split club, like the rapidly growing Broadcom.\nWhy split a stock? It helps open the door for smaller investors who are locked out of buying shares due to a steep price tag. On average, post-split stocks tend to perform well, but it's not a guarantee.   It could just be that splits tend to happen with stocks that already have positive momentum.\nYou might be curious, which company is next? I don't have a crystal ball, unfortunately, but here are my three picks for which companies it could be.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is emerging as one of the strongest AI plays. It has a massive amount of engaged daily users -- 3.2 billion by the company's count. This number is up 7% year over year across its different platforms, which stand to benefit greatly from the tools the company collectively calls Meta AI.\nThe company saw its earnings per share (EPS) more than double last quarter, compared to the year before. This came with a nearly 30% jump in revenue and a huge bump in operating margin. The company also cut 10% of its staff this year.\nThis success drove its share price up 83% since last year. Now hovering above $500, it's the most expensive stock of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nMeta has never split its stock since it's been on the market. It seems ripe for a split.\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) went on a tear this year with a year-to-date gain that would make Nvidia blush. The semiconductor company also designs and manufactures hardware critical for AI but arguably has a more diversified revenue stream than Nvidia.\nThe two actually work together. Supermicro uses Nvidia's chips in its data center servers.\nSupermicro has a lot of growth ahead. Of course, predicting the future is always difficult, but consensus estimates put the company's 2024 EPS growth at more than 100% from last year.\nSupermicro's shares are already expensive, trading near $900. If these estimates hold true, this company could easily be trading at a significantly higher price. It seems likely a split is coming for SMCI, as well.\nCalling Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) an AI company might be a stretch. They do make shows about AI -- if you haven't watched Black Mirror, please do -- but that hardly seems to qualify.\nThe company has actually employed AI for a while, or at least machine learning, the technology at the core of AI. Every large language model (LLM) you see on the market, like ChatGPT, is based on machine learning algorithms.\nThe algorithms Netflix employs learn what you like and what you don't. Based on this, they provide you recommendations. The more you use it, the better it gets. The company helped pioneer this feature that's now standard across all streaming platforms.\nNetflix leads the streaming pack with more than 260 million subscribers. That's a lot of eyeballs that make the service valuable. The company is capitalizing on this, instituting new programs to raise revenue. It seems to be working as consensus estimates put this year's earnings-per-share (EPS) growth at roughly 40% year over year.\nNetflix stock is trading at nearly $700. That's already at a level that could benefit from a stock split. That may well be what happens, but only time will tell.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $791,929!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Nvidia will produce such a massive ‘cash gusher’ that it will have to buy back more stock because all that money has nowhere else to go, analyst says",
        "Author": "  Jason Ma ",
        "Text": "AI chip leader Nvidia will have an embarrassment of riches in the coming years, and shareholders will be rewarded, a tech analysts predicted.\nBen Reitzes, a managing director and head of technology research at Melius Research, told CNBC on Wednesday that Jensen Huang's Nvidia has mastered a \"full stack\" approach with its hardware and software, giving it a key advantage in AI.\n\"What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously they're killing it,\" he said.\nReitzes has a price target of $160 on Nvidia stock, implying a 30% gain from Friday's closing price. Despite an ongoing selloff that began earlier this month, shares have soared 150% so far this year after more than tripling in 2023. Among the Magnificent 7 stocks that he covers, Nvidia has the most upside ahead, he added.\nAnother big advantage Nvidia has over rivals is its annual cadence of innovating new products, Reitzes said. That means developers and customers will know where Nvidia is headed and can budget for upgrades accordingly.\n\"And they're running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It's going to be hard to catch these guys,\" he said.\nGiven Nvidia's edge in the booming AI space, Melius Research projects the company will generate $270 billion in cash over the next three years, potentially setting the stage for huge shareholder returns.\nManagement may not be eager to tout the possibility of stock buybacks as those are often associated with older companies, Reitzes said. But in his view, it's obvious.\n\"No one's talking about it, and when you do the model we do, it's a cash gusher,\" he said. \"And there's nothing they can do. This government's not going to let them buy anything big. They can't invest that much in R&D. It's just not possible. So we gotta get it as shareholders.\"\nTo be sure, Nvidia has been returning capital to shareholders. In August, it announced a $25 billion repurchase program. And last month, Nvidia boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10, equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis.\nNvidia declined to comment about the possibility of more stock buybacks.\nFor his part, Reitzes was quick to point out that any future buybacks wouldn't imply that Nvidia has stopped growing. \"It's not an insult to buy back stocks if you have nothing else to do.\"\nNvidia's recent financials show that its ability to generate cash is accelerating. In the fiscal year that ended in January, Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities soared to $28.1 billion from $5.6 billion in the prior year.\nAnd in the first quarter that ended in April, net cash provided by operating activities was $15.3 billion—already more than half of last year's total.\nMeanwhile, Huang told investors this past week that Nvidia will remain the gold standard for AI training chips amid concerns that rivals could cut into his market share.\nThe rollout of Nvidia’s Blackwell system later this year will only cement that lead, he said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.\n“The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history,” Huang said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q2 earnings season, the July Economic Outlook monthly and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Amgen Inc. (AMGN), as well as a micro-cap stock Galaxy Gaming, Inc. (GLXZ). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\nThe July Economic Outlook \nJohn Blank, our Chief Economist, discusses the evolving economic landscape and what that means for Fed policy in the July Economic Outlook report. You can see John's report here >>>To Cut, or Not to Cut - That is the Question\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard \nIncluding this morning's releases from the likes of D.R. Horton, Abott, Keycorp and others, we now have Q2 results from 61 S&P 500 members or 12.2% of the index's total membership. \nTotal earnings for these 61 index members are up +7.5% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 82% beating EPS estimates and 55.7% beating revenue estimates. The 82% EPS beats percentage for this group of 61 index members compares to 77% in 2024 Q1, 80.3% in 2023 Q4 and the average for the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) of 79.6%. \nThe 55.7% revenue beats percentage for this group of companies compares to 63.9% in the preceding period and 20-quarter low of 60.7%. \nIn other words, companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus revenue estimates at this stage in the Q2 reporting cycle. \nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 61 companies with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are on track to be up +8.8% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. \nFor a more detailed look at the Q2 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+157.4% vs. +115.3%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+48.5% vs. +14.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. It is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 175 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)Amgen shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+45.4% vs. -4.4%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to offset declining revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in 2024. The addition of Horizon’s rare disease drugs should further boost revenue growth. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several key pipeline data readouts are expected in 2024, including from the obesity program, MariTide. However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimates have gone down ahead of Q2 earnings releases.(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)Shares of Galaxy Gaming have underperformed the Zacks Gaming industry over the past year (-46.1% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $35.69 million is witnessing high debt levels, reliance on key customers, regulatory risks, intense competition, economic cycle vulnerability and integration risks as well as challenges posing from new acquisitions.Nevertheless, Galaxy Gaming's revenues for first-quarter 2024 grew 7.8% year over year to $8 million, driven by the success of EZ Baccarat and GOS product installations. EBITDA of $3 million, with a margin of 37.5%, highlights strong operational efficiency. The 10-year extension with Evolution Gaming and EZ Baccarat expansion solidifies the market position. Innovations like GOS 2.0 and global expansion, with operations in 30 countries and 5,146 table installations, enhance growth prospects. Financial stability is demonstrated with a 4.8% cash increase to $17.5 million and a net leverage ratio of 3.8x. High customer satisfaction and a 91.7% recurring revenue model reduce financial risk. (You can read the full research report on Galaxy Gaming here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), GE Aerospace (GE) and BHP Group Limited (BHP).Director of ResearchSheraz MianNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.
