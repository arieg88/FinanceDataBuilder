        "Text": "You know those far-fetched headlines asking if a stock can go to $10,000 by 2025, but it’s only trading at $1,000? It is pure silliness. However, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock could be the exception.\nAs I write this, Nvidia’s share price is $904, up 14% for the month, 107% for six months, 234% for the past 52 weeks, and 1,912% over the last year. From its October 2022 low of around $112, it’s up 707% in 18 months.\nTo reach $10,000 by the end of 2025, Nvidia must generate a compound annual growth rate of nearly 300%. It seems outlandish and probably is, but if the company continues to deliver AI-fueled growth in 2024 and 2025, I’m not sure investors can count it out.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nI mean, look at Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). Over the past 30 years, its shares have appreciated by around 200,000%, a CAGR of nearly 29%.\nNow, beverages might not have cyclical corrections like chip companies, but they also don’t have the kind of rocket-fueled growth that chip companies experience, especially when we’re talking about life-altering technology like generative AI.\nI don’t think it can reach $10,000 by 2025. But if it did, here’s how it would do so.\nNvidia trades at a multiple of nearly 75 times its trailing 12-month earnings and 35.6 times its forward earnings.\nThe latter is actually below its five-year average of 39.3x. At the same time, its price-to-sales ratio is 36.6x, while its five-year average is 18.2x.\nIts PEG ratio, at 1.55, suggests that it is undervalued, considerably lower than its five-year average of 2.44.\nFor those unfamiliar with the PEG ratio, it is P/E (current price divided by EPS estimate for the current fiscal year) divided by its projected 5-year EPS growth rate.\nAs Motley Fool contributor David Jagielski pointed out in February, Nvidia’s EPS growth rate projection is very bullish for Nvidia. Any unexpected slowdown in AI would put a major dent in the PEG ratio.\nIn a January article, Jagielski quotes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman from his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.\n“It will change the world much less than we all think and it will change jobs much less than we all think,” Altman said.\nInvestors are faced with a dilemma. Buy into the AI hype, and face crippling losses as NVDA stock returns to more historical levels below $400.  Before June 2023, it had never traded above $400.\nThe only way Nvidia will get to $10,000 by the end of 2025 is if the PEG ratio expands to a five-year average double where it is now.\nNo one understood that AI was a big deal until ChatGPT came out. Then, a light went on in most people’s heads that this technology was a game-changer. That was November 30, 2022. It’s been out there for 16 months.\nIn February 2023, ChatGPT Plus launched for subscribers only. Everyone and their dog is trying to create the next great generative AI app or program.\nThe University of Toronto’s Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society published a commentary on Jan. 31, 2023, called ChatGPT “a game changer for artificial intelligence.”\n“With more than one million users within the first five days of its launch, followed by news that Microsoft will invest US $10 billion in OpenAI in January 2023, ChatGPT is a transformative development in AI natural language processing,” the institute’s commentary stated.\nOne area that will benefit from ChatGPT and AI is academia. Plenty of university students will use the technology to cheat their way through school. However, there is so much good from the technology.\n“Tech’s ability to revolutionize schools has been overhyped in the past, and it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement around ChatGPT’s transformative potential,” stated MIT Technology Review contributor Will Douglas Heaven in April 2023. “But this feels bigger: AI will be in the classroom one way or another. It’s vital that we get it right.”\nWe don’t know what lies beyond the original generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Claude, Jasper, etc.\nThat could be an even bigger revenue generator than current AI initiatives. Nvidia would surely benefit.\nThe only caveat: It won’t happen soon enough to get NVDA stock to $10,000 by 2025.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Author": "  Alex Sirois ",
        "Text": "It’s been about a week since CEO Jensen Huang packed a who’s who of the tech world into a stadium in San Jose. Huang was there to unveil the latest chips from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) code named Blackwell. Those chips are widely expected to improve on the company’s already dominant h100 chips. The announcement should benefit multiple AI stocks and has given Huang’s company a bit of a bounce following recent turbulence. This has led to this list of stocks to profit from Nvidia’s Blackwell.\nThe chips code named Blackwell or expected to improve on Nvidia’s h100 chips and pull the company even higher. In turn, that should pull the wider AI sector that the company anchors higher again.\nIn other words the introduction of the Blackwell chips should be a strong catalyst within the already surging AI sector.  With that in mind let’s look at seven stocks that should benefit from the recent conference.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia stock should be the biggest beneficiary of the recent unveiling of the Blackwell chip.\nInvestors should anticipate that demand for those chips will be similarly strong to demand for the company’s h100 chips. CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Blackwell chips will basically quadruple the efficiency of AI model training once released. Training a current AI model takes 90 days and requires 8,000 h100 GPUs and 15 megawatts of power. A similar model could be trained over the same period of time with 2000 Blackwell chips and 4 megawatts of power.\nIt’s also expected that those chips could cost north of $50,000. Nvidia’s h100 chips have been wildly in demand with prices rising above $40,000 per chip at times.\nNvidia has become extremely valuable because the company has invested in AI for more than a decade. that early investment has paid off and led to a commanding market lead in AI. The company isn’t without competition but Nvidia controls roughly 4/5 of the AI computation market.\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a leading provider of memory chips and an important supplier of those chips to Nvidia. Its stock is currently benefiting from a strong earnings report which is one reason to buy the stock. That aside, let’s look at what Micron does and how that relates to Nvidia.\nMicron Technology is an important supplier of high bandwidth memory chips that Nvidia uses to enable AI workloads on its hardware. At the end of February it was announced that Micron Technology had started mass production of those HBM memory chips to be used in Nvidia’s AI semiconductors.\nNvidia is diversifying its supply chain for HBM chips. Micron Technology will be the sole link in the supply chain within the domestic market. Previously, South Korea’s SK Hynix was the sole provider of the HBM chips. However, Nvidia also announced that it was testing HBM chips from Samsung – another Korean giant – at the same time. It’s one of those stocks to profit from Nvidia’s Blackwell.\nMU stock has tremendous potential to grow should the company prove successful as an HBM supplier.\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) share prices fell in the wake of Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference where the Blackwell chip was announced. The company continues to attempt to chip away at Nvidia’s 80% dominance over computational AI chips.\nEssentially, there wasn’t any specific business related news that should have sent amd’s shares lower. That’s a good thing because investors should not forget that AMD is also set to introduce next generation AI chips this year.\nAMD is slated to release its updated MI300 chips later this year. Those chips will feature technology that is set to upgrade its MI300 chips. Those chips are expected to compete with the Blackwell B100 from Nvidia. AMD is expected to release MI400 chips in 2025.\nThose updated MI300 chips will include high bandwidth memory technology on par with that being used in Nvidia chips. AMD continues to challenge Nvidia especially in relation to price versus performance metrics. If Nvidia’s greed ends up getting the better of the company AMD will be right there to pick up the slack. This makes it one of those stocks to profit from Nvidia’s Blackwell.\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) stock recently popped after it was revealed that Nvidia has made a significant investment in the voice AI firm. It should continue to be strong in the wake of the Blackwell chip announcement by Nvidia.\nVoice AI or conversational AI is one of the next niche areas within artificial intelligence. SoundHound AI is one of the leaders in that vertical and provides services to firms from data centers to restaurants.  However, Blackwell chips are particularly important in relation to autonomous vehicles, another strength of SoundHound AI.\nWhat’s important to note here is that Nvidia’s generative AI will work in concert with SoundHound AI’s voice AI in an  in vehicle voice assistant. Nvidia invested in SoundHound AI because it applies to its Nvidia Drive platform. That platform has evolved to use the upcoming Blackwell B100 chips which should open a broader runway for SoundHound AI in the process. That is the primary reason to watch its stock in the wake of the GTC conference. This makes it one of those stocks to profit from Nvidia’s Blackwell.\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\nARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) stock is similar to SoundHound AI in that it was also recently revealed to be among Nvidia’s small but influential portfolio of holdings.The fact that Nvidia has invested in arm stock is certainly important but there is a more important factor to consider in the wake of the Blackwell announcement.\nIt’s reasonable to believe that ARM Holdings’ business model just got significantly stronger. Generally speaking, arm Holdings gets paid more as the complexity of Nvidia’s chips increases. That is true because Nvidia increasingly leverages IP from ARM Holdings of late. The company’s advanced chip technology designs are required in many of Nvidia’s most recent AI chips for various applications. That means that the price of licensing has increased dramatically of late. It’s also true that more and more of those IP designs are required. The result is that ARM Holdings is booming.\nThat should only continue to increase as Nvidia releases more and more advanced chips including the Blackwell B100.\nSource: Shutterstock\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) remains closely correlated to Nvidia even after the company announced that it would offer 2 million shares of stock.\nThe company’s shares failed dramatically after it announced its intention to sell 2 million additional shares of common stock in order to raise capital. While that is certainly going to raise fear of subsequent dilution moving forward, it also creates a buying opportunity.\nSuper Micro Computer helps chip firms design Server racks and storage clusters that are important in the realm of data centers. The close relationship between Super Micro Computer and Nvidia has sent shares of the latter soaring in recent months.\nThe bullish outlook on Super Micro Computer is simply that the company needs more capital to chase continued growth. The recent issuance of 2 million shares seems more innocuous when viewed in that light. In any case, the company is likely to see continued demand for its services from Nvidia as the company introduces its Blackwell B100 chips. Those chips will be in demand for data center applications and Super Micro Computer plays a vital role in designing the server racks needed therein.\nSource: Shutterstock\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has recently closened its ties with Nvidia in relation to packaging opportunities. That’s one reason to believe in Intel stock following the reveal of the Blackwell chips.\nThe two companies recently announced that they will be working together to strengthen Nvidia’s packaging supply chain requirements. It’s reasonable to assume that the release of the Blackwell B100 chip will provide further opportunities for Intel in that regard.\nIntel has advanced packaging capacity in Oregon and New Mexico which will serve to alleviate some of Nvidia’s supply chain issues especially in regard to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM).\nInvestors should also consider that Intel was recently awarded $8.5 billion dollars in U.S. subsidies In relation to the Chips act. Although the news isn’t directly related to Nvidia’s most recent announcement it is a positive catalyst overall period. It’s clear that the United States remains highly concerned about the threat of China to its neighbors including Taiwan. That is opening new avenues of opportunity for Intel.\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The stock is up nearly 500% over the last year and 70% in 2024 alone. Investors have warmed to the theme of investing in data center infrastructure on the back of burgeoning demand from artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\nThis week's move follows the news that Vertiv has become a \"Solution Advisor: Consultant partner\" in Nvidia's partner network.\nWhen asked about power delivery to its newest AI GPUs at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia and Vertiv engineers were \"working on cooling systems\" and that \"Vertiv is very important in the supply chain of designing liquid cooled and otherwise data centers.\"\nThe company is an important part of the growth of AI and data centers, as seen in its order book. Vertiv's organic orders rose 23% year over year in its recently reported fourth quarter, leading to a record backlog of $5.5 billion. Considering that figure, management expects 2024 sales to range from $7.515 billion to $7.655 billion -- with the midpoint representing a 10% organic increase.\nManagement expects its sales increase to leverage into operating profit growth of 23% in 2024. It's a hugely impressive set of numbers from a company that entered 2023 with some question marks following a disappointing 2022.\nWhile Vertiv's valuation may start to look stretched at 36 times estimated 2024 earnings, the AI investing boom appears to have legs, and investors should keep an eye on Vertiv's order book through the year for confirmation of ongoing growth.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vertiv right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vertiv, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertiv wasn’t one of them.

        "Text": "There's little question that artificial intelligence (AI) has been on a hot streak over the past year or so, and that trend shows little signs of slowing.\nIt isn't just average investors that are bullish on these developments. Billionaires, venture capital firms, and some of the world's biggest tech companies have AI fever -- and one start-up in particular is attracting a lot of attention.\nFigure AI is working on a humanoid robot -- dubbed Figure 01 -- that has attracted a lot of attention. It was founded by serial entrepreneur Brett Adcock, who also founded Archer Aviation -- an aerospace company working on an all-electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.\nIn its most recent funding round, the start-up attracted financing from billionaire Jeff Bezos and Ark Investment Management's Cathie Wood, as well as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and AI wunderkind OpenAI -- the start-up that arguably kicked off the AI revolution. Figure AI raised roughly $675 million, which valued the start-up at roughly $2.6 billion.\nFigure AI developed an autonomous robot that can help alleviate labor shortages in warehouses, transportation, and retail. Just last week, Figure released a video to demonstrate its progress. It says these fields have 7 million unfilled jobs and not enough workers to fill them. Figure recently announced its first commercial agreement to supply BMW with general-purpose robots for automotive production.\nIt might be difficult for investors to invest directly in Figure AI, as the start-up is privately held, but they can invest indirectly. For example, Microsoft is among the largest investors at $95 million, so buying shares of Microsoft will get you indirect exposure to Figure AI, though a very small amount.\nHowever, there are plenty of other reasons to buy Microsoft to take part in the AI revolution.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
