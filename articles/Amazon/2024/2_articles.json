The retailer is poised to grow its ad revenue by nearly 40% this year, according to forecasts by Insider Intelligence. That's more than any other company.\nAmong the businesses expected to significantly expand their ad sales in 2024 are others in the grocery and retail space seeking the higher margins of digital ads — Instacart (CART), Target (TGT), and, you guessed it, Amazon (AMZN) — turning their online platforms into another system for steering user attention and money. It's a natural evolution for these companies, which have also become powerful search engines, hosts of user-generated content (reviews! usernames!), and content publishers over the years.\nWalmart's move to capture more data and advertising power comes as Amazon grew its ads business 27% year over year, according to its most recent quarterly report.\nThe market's deference to Big Tech and the eagerness to turn legacy and digital operations into ad portals have been revealed in other ways. Next week Amazon, the No. 3 player in the digital ads world behind Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META), will join the elite members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\"Reflecting the evolving nature of the American economy, this change will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other business areas in the DJIA,\" said S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the 30-stock gauge. Or, as S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt bluntly put it on Yahoo Finance Live, the index added Amazon because it \"needs to stay relevant.\"\nOut is Walgreens (WBA), and in is the Big Tech hydra of e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and online advertising.\nAmazon is becoming an ad tech giant while the nation's largest retailer is busy turning itself into a tech company. \"Digital advertising is the future of Walmart,\" Oliver Chen, a senior research analyst at TD Cowen, told Yahoo Finance Live.\nAnd while this may sound somewhat silly at first glance, it's yet another way a company can gain advantage through vertical integration: owning the store and the billboards. Or in this case, the screens that function as both.\n\"There is a marketplace opportunity in third-party selling, and there's also a big digital advertising opportunity,\" Chen said. Vizio's smart TV operating system claims 18 million accounts.\nIn another sign of the times, the ride-hailing giant Uber will replace JetBlue Airways in the Dow Jones Transportation Average so the index can gain exposure to the ridesharing industry.\nBut as Wall Street has made clear, it's not enough for a transportation company powered by algorithms and human drivers to do business as a tech platform. The ad dollars from users scrolling for Chinese food or riding home are just sitting there.\nDuring the company's most recent earnings call earlier this month, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he expects Uber's advertising business to exceed $1 billion in 2024.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "For years, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was known for bold risks and minimal profits as the company invested in its businesses to grow revenue and market share, building out its customer base and competitive advantages.\nUnder CEO Andy Jassy, who's run the company for more than two years, Amazon has shifted from an experimental, growth-focused start-up to a more mature company ready to monetize its existing businesses and be more disciplined with its capital.\nJassy laid off roughly 28,000 corporate employees last year and shut down unprofitable projects like the Scout home delivery and Amazon Care telehealth services. Those moves helped the company deliver soaring profits in 2023, and that leverage was on display in Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings report, out last week.\nRevenue in Q4 rose 14% to $170 billion, beating the analyst consensus at $166.2 billion. The company's growth was even across its three business segments. At its North America and international segments, which are primarily made up of e-commerce sales, revenue rose 13% and 17%, respectively. North American revenue reached $105.5 billion, while international revenue was $40.2 billion.\nAmazon Web Services, the cloud infrastructure business that has been the company's primary cash cow in recent years, reported 13% growth to $24.2 billion. That was slower than both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, a sign that Amazon is losing market share, but it's still the biggest cloud infrastructure business.\nOn the bottom line, all three divisions delivered solid growth as well. North America's operating income was $6.5 billion, up from a loss of $0.2 billion in the same quarter a year ago. In its international segment, the operating loss narrowed from $2.2 billion to $0.4 billion, and AWS' operating profit improved from $5.2 billion to $7.2 billion.\nJassy explained the solid growth in e-commerce, saying, \"The regionalization of our U.S. fulfillment network led to our fastest-ever delivery speeds for Prime members while also lowering our cost to serve.\"\nThis is the kind of operational improvement that Jassy has excelled at, and it's no easy feat for a retailer the size of Amazon to grow revenue by 13%.\nAmazon stock still looks expensive on a price-to-earnings basis and the company's revenue growth is unlikely to accelerate significantly from where it is today.\nHowever, its operating income in the fourth quarter soared from $2.7 billion to $13.2 billion, and its margins are likely to continue to expand because Amazon's fastest-growing businesses are its most profitable. They are the ones that are built on the investments it made earlier, like its first-party e-commerce business and its massive logistics and fulfillment network.\nFor example, advertising revenue grew 27% to $14.7 billion. Amazon doesn't report advertising profits, but that is very likely high-margin revenue. Alphabet's Google, for example, generates an operating margin in the 30% range from its advertising business.\nAdditionally, Amazon's third-party seller services revenue grew 20% to $43.6 billion. That income represents the fees Amazon charges marketplace sellers to sell on Amazon and use its fulfillment services, so it's also high-margin. Amazon has a lot of leverage here as it has no direct competition from a large e-commerce marketplace in many of the countries it operates in, and it benefits from the traffic it draws to its site, making its platform attractive to third-party sellers.\nAWS should also see revenue growth reaccelerate as usage for running artificial intelligence (AI) models picks up, driving the need for cloud infrastructure services, but the company doesn't need AI to be successful.\nAmazon introduced a new AI shopping assistant, Rufus, and talked up other AI initiatives, but Amazon's competitive advantages are strong enough that profits should continue to grow at a steady clip and margins should expand in any case. And that should make the stock a winner again in 2024.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN joined the blue-chip index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA on Feb 26.The reshuffle reflects the ongoing shift in economic power from traditional brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce and technology-driven companies. The inclusion of Amazon in the Dow marks a significant milestone in the recognition of the e-commerce giant's influence and its role in the broader market.The shift was prompted by Walmart's WMT decision to execute a 3-to-1 stock split, which has reduced its stock's weighting in the index. The Dow is a price-weighted index. So, stocks that fetch higher prices are given more weight. Amazon's addition has increased consumer retail exposure within the index, alongside enhancing the representation of various other business sectors that Amazon engages in, including cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence, among others (read: Walmart Soars on Earnings, Dividend & Vizio Deal: ETFs to Buy).Amazon took the 17th position in the index, while Walmart's weighting dropped to 26 from 17. UnitedHealth Group remained the most heavily weighted stock in the index. Amazon's entry into the Dow Jones is not just a symbolic change but a reflection of the evolving priorities and dynamics within the investment world. It signals a broader recognition of the value and impact of technology and e-commerce sectors, encouraging investors to perhaps rethink their investment approaches in light of these trends.While the Dow Jones is making new record highs, its performance is lagging behind the S&P and Nasdaq over the past year. The underperformance is due to the lack of exposure in tech stocks and the “Magnificent Seven” companies in particular. The Dow includes two of the Magnificent Seven — Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. Amazon will be the third. As such, the addition of Amazon will help Dow Jones catch up with the S&P 500 gains. The shares of the commerce giant have surged more than 80% over the past year (read: ETFs to Tap on Amazon's Strong Q4 Earnings).   Given this, investors seeking to tap the potential strength in the Dow Jones trend could consider SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, iShares Dow Jones U.S. ETF IYY, Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF DJD and First Trust Dow 30 Equal Weight ETF EDOW.\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA)SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with AUM of $33.1 billion and an average daily volume of 3.8 million shares.

        "Title": "5 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After examining many stocks in today's market, I've concluded that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the best buys available. Even though it's had a strong 2024, up 11%, I still think there is room for upside. I've pinpointed five factors that make Amazon a strong buy now, even with its great performance in 2024.\nWhile Amazon is well-known for its commerce business, it has quietly transitioned to a service business. These divisions include third-party seller services, advertising services, subscription services, and its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Combined, these segments brought in $92.9 billion in revenue versus the commerce side's revenue of $75.7 billion.\nThis is critical, as these services are vital for many businesses, which makes them more sustainable. Additionally, even though Amazon doesn't break out the profitability of each division, looking at similar companies like Shopify for third-party sellers or Alphabet for advertising, it's evident that services have much better margins.\nThis leads me to my next reason for buying. Thanks to the rise of service divisions, Amazon's gross margins have skyrocketed over the past decade.\nA higher gross margin gives Amazon the potential to have a better profit margin, which has also improved in recent quarters after tanking thanks to overspending to fulfill pandemic-era demand. This will be a key metric for investors to watch as Amazon attempts to transition to becoming a company maximized for profits.\nA key profit contributor is AWS, the cloud computing business. In the fourth quarter, Amazon's North American commerce business made $6.5 billion in operating profits, while the international business lost $419 million. However, AWS picked up the slack, producing $7.2 billion in operating profits despite having much lower sales figures (AWS had $24.2 billion in sales in Q4 versus North American commerce sales of $106 billion).\nAWS saw its profitability dip slightly as 2022's Q4 operating margin was 24%. But it promptly recovered in 2023, and Q4 saw an operating profit of 30%\nOne item that has come into the spotlight is AWS's growth. In Q4, it was up 13%, while competitors Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure both saw revenue growth in the high 20% range. While there are multiple reasons for this, Amazon's management is starting to see new workloads come online, which should boost AWS's growth throughout 2024. This is key as AWS is vital to Amazon's profitability.\nWhile Amazon has had a strong year, its stock remains reasonably priced. Using traditional valuation metrics like a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't ideal with Amazon, as it isn't fully optimized for profits. Instead, I'll use the price-to-sales ratio to evaluate the business. At three times sales, Amazon is valued at about the same level it was in 2018 and still below where it was during the pandemic sell-off.\nLast is maybe the most important factor of all: Improving cash flows. Amazon's cash flows are dramatically up due to AWS' turnaround, the rise of service divisions, and improving margins.\nAmazon's Q4 cash flows were the highest they've ever been and helped propel its trailing-12-month total to new records.\nWith that cash, Amazon can pay down debt, repurchase shares, or fund dividends. Those actions benefit shareholders and are the primary reasons for investing in Amazon's stock.\nDespite Amaozn's strength since the start of 2023 and so far in 2024, it's still a great buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "Author": "  Matthew Field ",
        "Text": "Jeff Bezos has sold more than $4bn (£3.2bn) worth of Amazon stock, as the tech tycoon looks to cash in on some of his vast holdings.\nThe Amazon founder bolstered his $190bn fortune in recent days by selling shares in two tranches worth $2bn apiece, which comes after his company’s share price neared an all-time high.\nAmazon’s shares have risen more than 12pc so far this year after the company reported a 14pc rise in Christmas sales last week. It recorded revenues of $170bn in the three months to December.\nThe share sales are Mr Bezos’s first since 2021 and follow his recent move from Washington state to Florida - where he will reportedly save hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.\nMiami, which has no income or capital gains tax, has become increasingly popular among the ultra-wealthy in recent years.\nThe state’s low taxes contrast with Seattle, Washington, where Mr Bezos had lived since 1994.\nHis sale of Amazon stock is likely to be considered a capital gain because he has owned the shares since he founded the company 30 years ago.\nThe Amazon chairman announced in November that he was moving to Florida with his fiancee Lauren Sanchez, claiming at the time it was because he wanted to be closer to his parents.\nHe now owns two mansions in Miami on an island dubbed “Billionaire Bunker”, which are worth $79m and $68m respectively.\nHis new neighbours include Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump and hedge fund billionaire Carl Icahn. Other nearby residents include Tom Brady, the American football star, who bought a $17m waterfront property in the area three years ago.\nThe Amazon founder lived in Florida with his family as a teenager, attending high school in the city.\nAfter cutting down his holdings over the years, Mr Bezos now owns just over 9pc of Amazon, having stepped down as chief executive in 2021.\nStill, his vast holding in the $1.7 trillion company makes him the world’s second-richest man with an estimated net worth of $193bn.\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
