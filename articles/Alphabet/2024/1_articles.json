The company, which is the parent of internet media giant Google, reported a significant increase in revenue and net income, attributing much of its success to its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a diversified technology conglomerate with Google as its flagship subsidiary. Google's diverse revenue streams include online advertising, sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, cloud service fees, and hardware sales. Alphabet also invests in ambitious \"moonshot\" projects through its Other Bets segment, aiming to revolutionize technology in health, internet access, autonomous driving, and more.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported a robust financial performance for Q4, with consolidated revenues of $86 billion, marking a 13% increase year over year. The growth was consistent in constant currency terms as well. Operating income rose to $23.7 billion, up from $18.16 billion in the same quarter the previous year, and net income increased to $20.68 billion, up from $13.62 billion. These results underscore the importance of Alphabet's AI investments, particularly in Search, YouTube, and Cloud services.\nDespite these achievements, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) faced challenges, including a workforce reduction and office space optimization, which led to significant charges. The company recorded $2.1 billion in employee severance and related charges and $1.8 billion in exit charges for office space optimization for the fiscal year 2023. These actions, while aimed at improving operational efficiency, resulted in considerable expenses that impacted the financial statements.\nThe company's financial achievements, particularly in the context of the Interactive Media industry, are significant. Alphabet's ability to consistently grow its revenue and maintain a high operating margin in a competitive and rapidly evolving sector demonstrates the effectiveness of its strategic focus on AI and innovation. The growth in Google Cloud revenues, which reached $9.19 billion in Q4, highlights the company's expanding presence in the cloud services market.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s financial strength is further illustrated by its balance sheet, with total assets increasing from $365.26 billion in 2022 to $402.39 billion in 2023. The company's liquidity position is solid, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $110.92 billion. The increase in net property and equipment to $134.345 billion reflects Alphabet's continued investment in its operational infrastructure.\nImportant metrics such as the operating margin, which improved to 27%, and diluted EPS, which increased to $1.64, are critical indicators of Alphabet's profitability and efficiency. These metrics are vital for investors as they assess the company's ability to generate earnings and manage expenses effectively.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s performance in Q4 and the fiscal year 2023 is a testament to the company's strategic vision and execution. The growth in key areas such as Search, YouTube, and Cloud, coupled with prudent cost management, has positioned the company for continued success. However, the charges related to workforce and office space optimization serve as a reminder of the ongoing need to adapt to market conditions and optimize operations.\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market, leveraging its AI capabilities to drive growth and efficiency. As the company enters what CEO Sundar Pichai refers to as the \"Gemini era,\" investors and industry observers will be keenly watching how Alphabet's investments in AI and other technologies continue to shape its financial trajectory.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Alphabet Inc for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript January 30, 2024\nAlphabet Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.64, expectations were $1.6.\nOperator: Welcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJim Friedland: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors discussed in our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2023. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai: Hello, everyone. Our results reflect strong momentum and product innovation continuing into 2024. Today, I'm going to talk about four main topics. One, our investments in AI, including how it's helping search. Two, subscriptions which reached $15 billion in annual revenue, up 5x since 2019. Subscriptions is growing strongly, powered by YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV and Google One. Three, Cloud which crossed $9 billion in revenues this quarter and saw accelerated growth driven by our Gen AI and product leadership. And four, our investments and focus to meet the growth opportunities ahead. First, AI and Search. As you know, we have long led the way in using AI to improve many of our products from search to ads, to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already.\nLast year brought new excitement around Gen AI and I'm proud of how we responded, responsibly with deep advances in foundation models and a number of great launches. We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances. Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our two world-class research teams. It's engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video and code in a natively multimodal way and it can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers. Gemini gives us a great foundation. It's already demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities and it's only going to get better. Gemini Ultra is coming soon.\nThe team is already working on the next versions and bringing it to our products. That starts with Search. We're already experimenting with Gemini in search where it's making our Search Generative Experience or SGE faster for users. We have seen a 40% reduction in latency in English in the U.S. I'm happy with what we are seeing in the earliest days of SGE, it's available through search labs in seven languages. By applying generative AI to Search, we are able to serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. People are finding it particularly useful for more complex questions like comparisons or longer queries. It's also helpful in areas where people are looking for deeper understanding such as education or even gift ideas.\nWe are improving satisfaction including answers for more conversational and intricate queries. As I mentioned earlier, we are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users and send valuable traffic to publishers. Beyond SGE, we are continuing to use AI to make searching more accessible and intuitive. Circle to Search, lets you search what you see on Android phones with a simple gesture without switching apps. It's available starting this week on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Series. And Lens now offers generative AI overviews. You can add text to a visual search to ask questions about anything you see and get AI-powered insights in the moment.\nIn addition to Search, we are also seeing a lot of interest in our AI-powered solutions for advertisers. That includes our new conversational experience that uses Gemini to accelerate the creation of search campaigns. Then there is Bard, our conversational AI tool that complements search. It's now powered by Gemini Pro and is much more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding and planning. It's now in over 40 languages and over 230 countries around the world. Looking ahead, we'll be rolling out an even more advanced version for subscribers powered by Gemini Ultra. That's a good segue to subscriptions. As I said earlier, it's now a $15 billion business annually. YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues.\nAvailable in over 100 countries and regions, YouTube Music and Premium have real momentum. They're engaging passionate users and driving great returns for the music industry and creators. YouTube TV is also doing well. We've had great consumer feedback on the viewing experience. People love the navigation, multi view and unlimited DVR. NFL Sunday Ticket has found it’s perfect home on YouTube and Philipp will talk about that more. Let me also talk about our subscription service, Google One. It's doing incredibly well with strong user growth. It provides expanded storage, unlocks exclusive features in Google products and allows us to build a strong relationship with our most engaged users. Google One is growing very well and we are just about to cross 100 million subscribers.\nFrom here, we are going to bring in more AI features and look forward to more strong growth to come. Next, Google Cloud. Throughout 2023, we introduced thousands of product advances, including broad Gen AI capabilities across our AI infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform and our new Duvet AI agents. In Q4, our product and Gen AI leadership enabled us to win and expand relationships with many leading brands including Hugging Face, McDonald's, Motorola Mobility and Verizon. Google Cloud offers our AI Hypercomputer, a groundbreaking supercomputing architecture that combines our powerful TPUs and GPUs, AI software and multi-slice and multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models. Customers like Anthropic, Character AI, Essential AI and Mistral AI are building and serving models on it.\nFor developers building Gen AI applications, we offer Vertex AI, a comprehensive enterprise AI platform. It helps customers like Deutsche Telekom and Moody's discover, customize, augment and deploy over 130 Gen AI models, including PaLM, Med-PaLM, Sec-PaLM and Gemini, as well as popular open source and partner models. Vertex AI has seen strong adoption with the API request increasing nearly 6x from H1 to H2 last year. Using Vertex AI, Samsung recently announced its Galaxy S24 Series smartphone with Gemini and Imagen 2, our advanced text-to-image model. Shutterstock has added Imagen 2 to their AI image generator, enabling users to turn simple text prompts into unique visuals and Victoria's Secret & Company will look to personalize and improve the customer experience with Gemini, Vertex AI search and conversations.\nCustomers are increasingly choosing Duvet AI, our packaged AI agents for Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform to boost productivity and improve their operations. Since its launch, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duvet AI. It will incorporate Gemini soon. In Workspace, Duvet AI is helping employees benefit from improved productivity and creativity at thousands of paying customers around the world, including Singapore Post, Uber and Woolworths. In Google Cloud Platform, Duvet AI assist software developers and cybersecurity analysis. Duvet AI for developers is the only Gen AI offering to support the company development and operations lifecycle, fine-tune with the customers’ own core corpus and policies.\nIt's helping Wayfair, GE Appliances and Commerzbank write better software, faster with AI code completion, code generation and chat support. With Duvet AI and security operations, we are helping cybersecurity teams at Fiserv, Spotify and Pfizer. Our robust growth has been driven by strong direct and indirect channels. With ISVs, we have nearly tripled the number of co-sell deals from 2022 to 2023. In our ecosystem, there are nearly 90,000 Google Cloud Gen AI-enabled consultants. And Accenture has teamed up with Google Cloud to create a joint generative AI center of excellence. Next, let me turn to our focus and discipline as we pursue the opportunities ahead. Search, YouTube and Cloud are supported by our state-of-the-art compute infrastructure.\nThis infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It's a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures. As just one example, our devices team has brought together different teams from across Nest, Fitbit and other teams into a new functional structure. This will help us pull resources and drive progress across our Pixel portfolio.\nAcross different teams, we have wound down some non-priority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas. We are also improving our machine utilization, building on our years of experience in driving cost efficiencies in our computing infrastructure and operations. And through our supplier efficiency efforts and automation of certain processes, we have made major improvements in areas like procurement, achieving significant savings. That's a snapshot of the quarter. Before I close, a couple of other highlights. Pixel 8, our AI-first phone, was awarded Phone of the Year by numerous outlets. It now uses Gemini Nano with features like Magic Compose for Google Messages and more to come. In our Other Bets portfolio of companies, Waymo, which is deeply focused on safety, reached over 1 million fully autonomous ride-hailing trips.\nAnd Isomorphic Labs entered into strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis to apply AI to treat diseases, which has great potential. 2023 was a year of profound innovation and product momentum. Thank you to our many partners. We succeed when our partners do, and we are grateful for the work we do together, from our partners across the Android ecosystem who are on display at CES to our deep relationships with retailers, small businesses and advertising partners, to the next generation of AI start-ups and developers and many more. I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work throughout 2023 and the start of the new year. I'm excited for what's ahead in 2024. Philipp?\nPhilipp Schindler: Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenues of $76 billion were up 12% year-on-year. In Google advertising, Search and other revenues grew 13% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical. We had particular strength in retail in APAC, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the end of the year. YouTube ads revenue were up 16% year-on-year, driven by growth in both direct response and brand. And network revenues declined 2% year-on-year. In Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices, which was previously named Google Other, year-on-year revenues increased 23% driven by strong growth in subscriptions. Now for some color on the quarter and where we see continued upside for long-term advertising growth.\nOver the last few calls, I have consistently highlighted how we're putting Google AI to work for our customers to deliver profitability and help them achieve their goals in a do-more-with-less environment. From a product perspective, in Q4, Performance Max remained a bright spot. We're also excited about [demand gen] momentum. This is our big bet to help social advertisers find and convert consumers via immersive, relevant visual creatives across YouTube, including YouTube Shorts, Gmail and Discover. In a single campaign, you get access to over three billion users as they stream, scroll, connect and decide what to buy. Tens of thousands of advertisers are testing and on average seeing 6% more conversions per dollar versus image-only ads and discovery campaigns.\nAs we look ahead, we're also starting to put generative AI in the hands of more and more businesses to help them build better campaigns and even better performing ads. Automatically created assets help advertisers show more relevant search ads by creating tailored headlines and descriptions based on each ads’ context. Adoption was up with strong feedback in Q4. In addition to now being available in eight languages, more advanced Gen AI-powered capabilities are coming to ACA. And then last week's big news was that Gemini will power a new conversational experience in Google Ads. This is open in beta to U.S. and UK advertisers. Early tests show advertisers are building higher-quality search campaigns with less effort, especially SMBs who are 42% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength.\nWe can't wait to see how this continues to drive performance and level the playing field for advertisers of all sizes. As we shared last quarter, ads will continue to play an important role in the new search experience, and we'll continue to experiment with new formats native to SGE. SGE is creating new opportunities for us to improve commercial journeys for people by showing relevant ads alongside search results. We've also found that people are finding ads either above or below the AI-powered overview helpful as they provide useful options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Looking at our strong Search performance for the fourth quarter. Retail was a highlight. We continue to see a stronger start to the season up to and including Cyber Five.\nIn Q3, we indicated that we were seeing early trends of consumers being very price-conscious, and we saw this play out in Q4. With promotional demand at an all-time high, deal seekers using Google had access to 2x the deals in the U.S. versus last season as well as a better shopping experience. Launches included a one-stop shop deals destination, new filters like GetItFast and AI-generated gifting recommendations in SGE. These new features drove incremental query growth during key shopping moments like Cyber Five. Our proven AI-powered ad solutions were also a win for retailers looking to accelerate omni growth and capture holiday demand. Quick examples include a large U.S. big-box retailer who drove a 60%-plus increase in omni ROAS and a 22%-plus increase in store traffic using Performance Max during Cyber-Five; and a well-known global fashion brand, who drove a 15%-plus higher omnichannel conversion rate versus regular shopping traffic by showcasing its store pickup offering across top markets through pickup later on shopping ads.\nMoving on to YouTube. We're obviously pleased with YouTube's advertising revenue growth in Q4 and also significant growth in our subscription revenue. I'll reiterate what I have said before. YouTube success starts with creator success. We give millions of creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to make money and build their own businesses than any other platform. More creators means more content, which leads to more viewers. And via ads and subscriptions, these viewers fund our creators and drive the eyeballs and engagement our advertisers want. To keep this momentum going, we're focused on delivering value across four pillars: creation, viewers, monetization and responsibility. First, creation, which increasingly takes place on mobile devices.\nWe've invested in a full suite of tools, including our new YouTube Create app for Shorts, to help people make everything from 15-second Shorts to 15-minute videos to 15-hour live streams with a production studio in the palm of their hands. Gen AI is supercharging these capabilities. Anyone with a phone can swap in a new backdrop, remove background extras, translate their video into dozens of languages, all without a big studio budget. We're excited about our first products in this area from Dream Screen for AI-generated backgrounds to allowed for AI-powered dubbing. There is more to come. Number two, viewers. We continue to grow watch time across YouTube with strong growth in Shorts and Connected TV. Shorts remains a top priority. We have 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, and we are averaging 70 billion in daily views.\nConnected TVs or what we refer to as the living room is where viewership is growing the fastest. We're investing to make this experience even better with interactive features tailored to TVs, plus the content people love: our creators, NFL Sunday Ticket and the range of live sports and studio content via YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. Put this all together, and YouTube is the must-have app on every Connected TV. Monetization is pillar number three and realized through a combination of ad-supported and subscription offerings. Advertising generates the bulk of our revenue, and we continue to invest heavily here. We've rolled out CTV-first formats like 30-second non-skippable ads and pause experiences as well as an industry-first send-to-phone experience that lets people use a second screen to engage with ads.\nFor Shorts, we've developed new formats that are less interruptive to viewers. It's early. We're learning but excited by the opportunities for ads this can unlock. Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. Our AI part video format from video reach and video view campaigns to demand gen and video action continue to make advertiser dollars go further and drive results across the funnel. We're also introducing new and existing advertisers to YouTube via sports content. 90-plus upfront and scatter advertisers, including Unilever, are partnering with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game advertising opportunities. Our subscription offerings are also growing at a healthy clip. YouTube Music and Premium performed well.\nPremium users are delivering more value to our partners and YouTube than even ad-supported users do. On average, each additional Premium sign-up boost earnings for creators, music and media partners and YouTube itself. And we've made Premium even more attractive with new features, bundles and other enhancements. We're also pleased with our first season of NFL Sunday Ticket. It gave creators new opportunities to create content and feed user engagement across traditional user content and professional sports content. Feedback on the user experience, including MultiView, has been great. We're excited to continue to innovate here. Responsibility is our fourth pillar, and it underlines everything we do across YouTube. We continue to focus relentlessly on this.\nAs always, deepening our relationships with key partners to bring them the best of Google is a key priority for us, and we continue to do this across industries in Q4. We just talked about the NFL. Sundar mentioned Samsung, among others earlier. Another highlight was our expanded partnership with Porsche to enhance customers' digital experiences with a deeper in-vehicle integration of Google built-in services, including Google Maps and Play. Whether it's continued collaboration with our partners and key ecosystems, we're putting Google AI to work for more customers. I'm excited about the opportunities for continued impact in 2024. I'll wrap with a huge note of gratitude to our customers and partners. Our success is only possible because of their success and then to our Googlers for their outstanding work and focus this year.\nRuth, over to you.\nRuth Porat: Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our full year results with 2023 Alphabet revenues of $307 billion, up 9% versus 2022, which added $25 billion to revenues for the year. We ended with a strong fourth quarter with consolidated revenues of $86.3 billion, up 13% versus last year in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. Total cost of revenues was $37.6 billion, up 6%. Other cost of revenues was $23.6 billion, up 5%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube subscription offerings. The growth rate also reflects the offsetting benefit of lapping $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges that we called out in the fourth quarter last year as well as a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect an additional $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated headcount. Operating expenses were $25 billion, up 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, which were driven by the real estate charges, followed by compensation. Operating income was $23.7 billion, up 30%, and our operating margin was 27%. Net income was $20.7 billion, and EPS was $1.64. We delivered free cash flow of $7.9 billion, which was affected by the timing of the $10.5 billion tax payment we made on October 16 that we called out previously related to the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter.\nFor the full-year 2023, free cash flow was $69 billion. We repurchased a total of $62 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2023 and ended the year with $111 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $76.3 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48 billion in the quarter were up 13%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $9.2 billion were up 16% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were down 2%. Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices revenues, which we previously referred to as other revenues, were $10.8 billion, up 23%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues.\nTAC was $14 billion, up 8%. Google Services operating income was $26.7 billion, up 32%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.2 billion for the quarter, up 26%. We're very pleased with the momentum of GCP with an increasing contribution from AI. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $864 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets, for the full-year 2023, revenues were $1.5 billion, and the operating loss was $4.1 billion. Results in the fourth quarter benefited from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising.\nWe were pleased with the sequential revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising throughout 2023, which reflects the extraordinary work across our teams to drive improved experiences for users and attractive ROI for advertisers. As we enter 2024 with advertising revenues of more than $100 billion higher than 2019, we remain focused on sustaining healthy growth on this larger base. Second, within Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices, our total revenues from subscription products reached $15 billion for the full-year 2023, driven primarily by substantial growth in subscribers for our YouTube subscription offerings. The substantial increase in our subscription revenues over the past few years demonstrates the ability of our teams to deliver high value-add offerings and provides a strong base on which to build, including through YouTube and newer services like Google One.\nPlay had solid growth again in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. In Devices, we continue to make sizable investments with increased emphasis on our Pixel family, particularly with AI-powered innovation while driving further efficiencies across the portfolio. Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with operating performance in the year. Full year revenues of $33 billion were up 26% versus prior year, ending with strong Q4 performance. The Cloud team is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini, our industry-leading AI technology, to enterprises and governments globally, and we are gratified with the level of engagement. The strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area.\nIn terms of profitability, the improvement in 2023 reflects sustained focus across the team with the intent to maintain healthy profitability while we continue to invest to support long-term growth. Turning to margins and expenses. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain committed to our framework to durably reengineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth priorities. Key contributors to moderating our expense growth include: first, product and process prioritization to ensure we have the right resources behind our most important opportunities and to reallocate resources where we can; second, organizational efficiency and structure. We're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. Both product prioritization and the organization design efforts result in a slower pace of hiring, as you can see with our headcount down year-on-year, reflecting the reductions we announced in the first quarter of 2023 and a much slower pace of hiring.\nWe will continue to invest in top technical and engineering talent. Finally, we continue to execute the other work streams to slow expense growth, including improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI, increasing efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization, and optimizing our real estate portfolio. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $11 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The step-up in CapEx in Q4 reflects our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers and governments globally and the long-term growth opportunities that offers.\nIn 2024, we expect investment in CapEx will be notably larger than in 2023. With regard to Other Bets, we've been working to sharpen our investment focus while capturing the upside given compelling technology breakthroughs across the portfolio. For example, last week, Alphabet's X announced that it would be moving to spin out more projects as independent companies through external capital, giving X the opportunity to bring more focus to the breakthrough technologies it is working on to address some of the world's most pressing challenges.

        "Text": "When internet giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) went public in 2004, it didn't have the monopoly on internet searches it has today. Granted, it still had between 35% and 44% market share, but few knew it would become the juggernaut it is today. More than 90% of searches now use Google, the world's most visited website.\nEach dollar invested in Alphabet's IPO would be worth $55 today. That 55x return over two decades crushes the broader stock market's comparable performance.\nWhile some things like Google search remain intact, Alphabet is a different company than it was back then. And it's likely to be a different type of investment moving forward.\nBuying into Alphabet early on would have easily carried an investment portfolio to success. Does Alphabet still have the juice to carry a portfolio? Here is what you need to know.\nThe search engine alone didn't make Alphabet such an excellent investment. Its success stems from arguably the most brilliant acquisition in corporate history. Alphabet spent $1.65 billion in stock to acquire video platform YouTube in late 2006. The company was less than two years old then, but Alphabet saw something special, and it was right.\nToday YouTube is the world's second-most visited website. The company generated nearly $8 billion in YouTube ad revenue in its most recently reported quarter. Based on that total, Alphabet effectively recoups its initial investment in YouTube every three weeks.\nThe combination of Google and YouTube turned Alphabet into a cash-printing machine that sells ads to companies that want to reach the largest internet audiences. Raking in nearly $78 billion in free cash flow over the past year, Alphabet is a deep-pocketed tech giant that can throw money at new opportunities, fend off (or acquire) potential threats, or cannibalize its shares (through repurchasing) to boost earnings growth.\nEvery company goes through phases where growth speeds up and slows down, but generally growth becomes harder as numbers get big. At nearly $300 billion in annual revenue, you can see that phenomenon in effect for Alphabet now (see chart below). Alphabet isn't the hyper-growth stock it was years ago. Therefore, investment returns won't look the same as in the past.\nBut that doesn't mean that Alphabet cannot still anchor a long-term portfolio.\nThe company still invests its profits in growth. It's built a cloud platform and launched software for mobile devices (Android), office software (Google Workspace), and generative AI (Gemini) to rival ChatGPT.\nBut it makes so much money that it has a lot left over. Alphabet currently has a whopping $120 billion in cash on its balance sheet against just $12 billion in debt. The stock doesn't pay a dividend, but management has instead begun repurchasing its stock. The number of outstanding shares has dropped 10% over the past five years, and shareholders should expect that to continue. Alphabet has spent $60 billion on repurchases over the past year alone.\nAlphabet is a well-followed stock on Wall Street and a member of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a handful of mega-cap technology stocks that soared in 2023. The stock price jumped 55% over the past 12 months.\nThe company's growth outlook looks promising, thanks largely to Alphabet's aggressive share repurchases. Analysts believe the company can compound earnings at over 17% annually over the long term.\nTrading at nearly 27 times earnings today, the stock isn't as cheap as before 2023's run. However, Alphabet could justify its higher valuation if it delivers growth that matches analysts' expectations. The current PEG ratio of 1.5 is reasonable for one of the world's strongest companies.\nThat doesn't mean shares won't be volatile along the way. If you do want to buy Alphabet, consider a dollar-cost average strategy. You buy the stock a little at a time to take advantage of the market's ups and downs, but leave some dry powder if shares fall to a more attractive valuation in the future.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\nSee the 10 stocks\n \n*Stock Advisor returns as of December 18, 2023\n \nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Text": "Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) charged sharply higher in 2023, soaring 58%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The rally was in sharp contrast to its performance in 2022, when the stock plunged 39%.\nWhile the company no doubt benefited from the improving economy, it was Alphabet's latest foray into artificial intelligence (AI) that has investors most excited.\nThe bear market that began in 2022 took a toll on Alphabet stock, as the digital advertising that generates the lion's share of Google's revenue dried up, resulting in year-over-year revenue declines. Businesses tend to slash marketing budgets during economic challenges to shore up their financial positions. As the industry leader in online advertising, Alphabet felt the impact more than most.\nThe improving economy in 2023 saw marketers loosen their purse strings, and ad spending resumed, which gave the company a boost. However, it was the advent of AI last year that really kicked Alphabet stock into high gear.\nAI is nothing new, having been around for decades. Furthermore, Alphabet has long used these algorithms to improve the accuracy and relevance of its search, ensure its digital advertising finds its target audience, and underpin the autonomous systems for its Waymo self-driving cars.\nHowever, advances in the field of generative AI promise to be a game changer, and Alphabet was quick to throw its hat in the ring. This latest branch of AI can create original content, summarize and draft email responses, create presentations, search the internet and company records for data, and even write and debug computer code.\nMicrosoft and its partnership with ChatGPT parent OpenAI was arguably the catalyst for the AI revolution that ensued, but Alphabet was quick to respond to the challenge. While its Bard chatbot initially stumbled, Google quickly recovered, infusing AI across a broad cross-section of its vast empire. AI-powered tools improved Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Slides, among others, while the company also announced plans to augment its search with new AI-fueled capabilities.\nPerhaps the most important development, however, was the debut of generative AI tools on Google Cloud. Just last month, the company announced the debut of Gemini AI, which the company called its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Google says its latest entry is far more advanced than GPT-4, which forms the foundation of ChatGPT, with five times the computational power.\nGemini was tested on various skills, including audio and video understanding, natural image, and mathematical reasoning, \"exceeding current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development.\" Gemini also scored 90% using massive multitask language understanding (MMLU), one of the predominant approaches for testing AI's problem-solving proficiency. This resulted in Gemini being the first generative AI \"model to outperform human experts\" using this standard.\nGiven the steady improvements in the economy and the company's foray into generative AI, 2024 is stacking up to be a good year for Alphabet. We don't know how big AI could be, but current estimates suggest a range of between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to data compiled by the McKinsey Global Institute.\nThat, combined with Alphabet's dominant position in search and digital advertising, suggests the company is well positioned coming into 2024. Make no mistake: Alphabet stock is a buy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.
