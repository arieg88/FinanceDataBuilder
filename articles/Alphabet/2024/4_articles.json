        "Text": "This probably wasn't what The Doors meant when they sang, \"c'mon on, baby, light my fire.\"\nThe legendary rock band's 1967 signature song was about turning people on instead of actually lighting things on fire.\nRelated: Wall Street faces make-or-break week with Tesla, GDP, inflation on deck\nBack in February, Waymo, the robotaxi company backed by Alphabet  (GOOG) , saw one of its vehicles set alight by a hostile group of individuals in San Francisco's Chinatown, with one person reportedly shouting \"Light that shit on fire!\"\nPolice filed charges against a 14-year-old boy last week, but then on Saturday, someone vandalized a Waymo vehicle, according to KRON4.\nThe video shows the person stomping the front windshield in an attempt to break it open.\nThe incident prompted Tesla  (TSLA)  CEO Elon Musk to post an exclamation mark on his X social media platform and write, \"Does make you feel sorry for the bots.\"\nNevertheless, Waymo announced plans to expand its network following a March 1 ruling by the California Public Utilities Commission.\nWaymo was one of the factors cited by Wall Street analysts on April 22 ahead of Google's parent company's quarterly results.\nAlphabet is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 25. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the company to report earnings of $1.51 per share, on $78.7 billion in revenue.\nA year earlier, Alphabet earned $1.17 per share on revenue of $69.8 billion.\nBoris Streubel/Getty Images\nLast year, Google Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat announced that she would be stepping down from Alphabet's top finance chief role to eventually assume a dual role of chief investment officer and president.\nShe became Google's CFO in 2015 and oversaw the transition into the company’s current Alphabet structure.\nRelated: Tesla crash continues as Musk doubles down on 'blindingly obvious' strategy\nMore recently, Porat told the company’s finance teams that their groups would see restructuring, including relocations and layoffs, CNBC reported last week.\n“The tech sector is in the midst of a tremendous platform shift with Al,” Porat wrote in the memo, obtained by CNBC, sent to finance employees.\n“As a company, this means we have the opportunity to make more helpful products for billions of users and provide faster solutions to our customers, but it also means we collectively have to make tough decisions, including how and where we work to align with our highest priority areas,” she said.\nThe restructuring will affect finance teams domestically and abroad, including in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\nKeyBanc analysts noted Porat's career move when they raised their price target on Alphabet to $175 from $165 while keeping an overweight rating on shares.\nAlphabet has near-term catalysts forming from multiple events: operating expense discipline, the Waymo expansion, a potential dividend, and a new CFO, the firm said.\nIn contrast, the analysts noted that Facebook parent Meta Platforms  (META)  \"having a wide revenue guidance range around unrest in the Middle East could alarm investors, particularly if the first quarter’s outperformance moderates.\"\nMeta is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 24 and KeyBanc cut its price target on the social media titan to $555 from $575 while maintaining a buy rating.\nThe firm said that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai's April 18 blog post entitled \"Building for our AI future\", signaled that the company is more focused on product velocity, and is taking actions to restructure divisions.\n\"We believe this is congruent with our view of layoffs persisting through 2Q and speaks to further operating income upside,\" Keybanc said.\nMore AI Stocks:\nAnalyst unveils eye-popping Palantir stock price target after Oracle deal\nVeteran analyst delivers blunt warning about Nvidia's stock\nAnalysts revamp Microsoft stock price target amid OpenAI reports\nThe analysts said Meta Platforms, an AI rival to Alphabet, continues to show progress with AI, from the expansion of Meta Assistant to the release of Llama 3, the latest iteration in Meta’s series of large language models.\nDuring the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call in January, Pichai told analysts that Alphabet has “led the way in using AI to improve many of our products from search to ads to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already.”\n\"We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances,\" he said. \"Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our two world-class research teams.\"\nKeyBanc analysts believe Alphabet's capital expenditures could reach $42 billion this year and $46 billion in 2025 as it continues to invest in AI technical infrastructure.\nRegarding dividends, the analysts noted that Meta surprised investors by implementing a dividend policy during its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\"Our sense is investors would like to see Alphabet follow Meta's lead as it represents a good use of cash and does not carry the headaches of M&A,\" KeyBanck said. \"While we believe the likelihood of a dividend has gone up, we believe it's hard to predict whether Alphabet will pursue this before or after a new CEO is chosen.\"\nOn April 17, Truist Securities analysts boosted their price target for Alphabet to $170 from $158 per share, while holding on to their buy rating.\nTruist said the adjustment reflected a positive outlook based on sustained user engagement and advertising revenue growth, particularly in Search and Social platforms.\nThe firm anticipates that Alphabet's first-quarter results will surpass consensus estimates, citing cost management as a key factor in driving year-over-year margin improvement.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n"

        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Alphabet’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nGood news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $214.59, but it is currently trading at US$158 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Alphabet’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 48% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

        "Title": "Alphabet’s Cash Boom Is Raising Dividend Hopes on Wall Street",
        "Author": "  Jeran Wittenstein, Ryan Vlastelica and Subrat Patnaik ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. is bringing in so much cash that hopes are rising it will take a page out of the Meta Platforms Inc. playbook and start paying a dividend.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUS Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes\nMalaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City\nBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows\nZuckerberg Asks for Patience as Meta’s AI Push Spooks Market\nHow to Get a Meeting With the UAE’s $1.5 Trillion Man\nThe search giant has been plowing excess cash into share buybacks for years and many investors expect another $70 billion to be earmarked when Alphabet reports earnings on April 25. But analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Truist Securities are among those that see a small dividend as a way to move the needle further for the stock, similar to Meta’s February move that helped fuel a 20% jump in shares.\n“A dividend would be well received,” said Andrew Zamfotis, portfolio manager at Ami Asset Management Corp. “While investors are still looking for growth from these companies, today there is also value in cost discipline and the decision to initiate a dividend suggests that management will be prudent and attempt to allocate capital in a way that balances growth and capital return.”\nDividends have traditionally been seen as the province of more mature and slower-growing companies but the policy has been gaining popularity among tech firms. In addition to Meta, Salesforce Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc. have also initiated dividends in recent months. Among the six biggest US technology companies by market value, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc. are the only ones that don’t have a quarterly payout.\nAlphabet shares are up 10% this year, outperforming Microsoft Corp., as well as the Nasdaq 100. Rising optimism about its generative AI strategy has supported the stock of late, though it fell to a three-month low in March in the wake of a disappointing earnings report and fears that artificial intelligence tools could challenge its dominance in search advertising.\nWith Alphabet’s revenue expected to rise 14% this year and cost cutting efforts supporting profitability, the company’s free cash flow is projected to hit a record $83 billion in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Google parent also had more than $110 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2023.\n“We think Alphabet is likely to follow Meta’s lead by introducing dividends this year,” said Tejas Dessai, research analyst at Global X ETFs. “Given the favorable advertising market and recent cost-saving measures, now seems opportune for such a move, which has generally been positively received by investors.”\nOf course, Alphabet faces other demands for its cash, such as adding AI computing capacity. The company had a record $32 billion in capital expenditures last year and that spending is expected to jump another 27% in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, the feeling on Wall Street is that Alphabet has plenty of cash for infrastructure spending as well as bigger capital returns.\nRather than seeing dividend initiations as a sign that the companies have fewer investment opportunities, market professionals are now viewing it as a sign of strength.\n“For corporations, sitting on cash in this environment is still suboptimal” said Jenny Harrington, chief executive officer at Gilman Hill Asset Management. “Even if they’re getting 5% on cash, the credit they get for returning cash to shareholders through dividends, or the bump they get from buybacks, mean that those are better capital allocation decisions.”\nTech Chart of the Day\nNvidia Corp shares plummeted 10% on Friday, their biggest one-day drop since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, and the stock closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since November. The slump erased nearly $212 billion off its market capitalization. The move came amid widespread tech selling, with AI companies seeing some of the most pronounced weakness. Shares edged higher on Monday, rising 2.8%.\nTop Tech Stories\nAfter years of working to assure the US government that its popular social media app isn’t a threat to national security, TikTok’s loss in that fight now seems almost inevitable.\nAustralia is gearing up for a showdown with Elon Musk and US social media giants over allegations they failed to move fast enough to police graphic content and misinformation during two violent attacks in Sydney over the past 10 days.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. options traders are contending with a rising wave of bearishness following the chipmaker’s cautious guidance and concerns about whether the artificial-intelligence trade is unwinding.\nApple has long relied on China and the iPhone for growth.

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has undoubtedly helped many of its early investors retire as millionaires.\nThe stock IPO'd at $85 in 2004, opened at $100, and closed its first day of trading at $100.34, so an ordinary investor could have easily bought the stock around $100 a share at the time of its debut. The company would later enact two stock splits, a nearly 2-to-1 split in March 2014 and a 20-to-1 split in July 2022. So if you bought what was then Google stock at $100 the first day it traded, you would have a split-adjusted cost basis of around $2.50 and a $20,000 investment would be worth close to $1.2 million today.\nAlphabet may not generate the same eye-popping returns it did in its first 20 years as a public company, but it still can be a core holding that can help you retire a millionaire.\nNot surprisingly, Alphabet is best known for its Google search engine. Google has become synonymous with search, leading to an estimated 90% global market share. Google is a cash cow for the company, with the search engine generating $175 billion in revenue in 2023, an increase of nearly 8% from 2022.\nThe solid revenue increase came despite 2023 being a relatively slow year for advertising growth as many advertisers were cautious with their ad budgets given uncertainties over the economy. However, search revenue often tends to be less economically sensitive compared to other types of advertising. The reason is that this type of advertising is performance-based and thus has a more measurable impact on sales.\nHowever, search isn't Alphabet's fastest-growing segment -- that title belongs to its cloud business, which grew its 2023 revenue by 26% to $33.1 billion. Google Cloud is a business with a lot of fixed costs in terms of data centers and engineering, so scale matters. The segment just turned profitable in 2023, but it is now set to grow its profitability at a quicker pace than revenue given the operating leverage in the business.\nAlphabet's other big business is YouTube, which generated $31.5 billion in revenue in 2023, up 8%. Like Google, it also gets much of its revenue from advertising. However, the company's YouTube Premium and Music services just surpassed 100 million subscribers. Both services offer ad-free content and contributed about $15 billion of YouTube's revenue.\nOne of the strengths of the YouTube video platform is that it does not have the upfront content costs of other video services, instead opting for a revenue-sharing model with content creators. This has helped the company avoid many of the profitability issues that have plagued other streaming services. The company is also looking to compete with TikTok through YouTube Short videos by incentivizing creators to use the platform. Monetization of YouTube Shorts is still early, but represents a large potential opportunity given the platform's over 2 billion monthly users.\nGiven its dominant position in search and strong cloud and YouTube businesses, Alphabet is trading at an inexpensive valuation despite trading near an all-time high. It trades at a forward P/E of about 22.5 times and an enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of just 12.5 times. The latter metric takes into consideration the company's large net cash position of $97.7 billion and removes any non-cash items. This alone makes the stock a buy.\nHowever, the big reason to own Alphabet over the long term, and why it could help you retire a millionaire, is its underrated position in artificial intelligence (AI). The company is currently seeing the most beneficial impact from AI in its cloud service business, where it has credited AI for helping it win and expand deals last quarter.\nHowever, there is some fear among investors that AI could disrupt Google's search dominance. So far there has been little indication of this happening. Traditional linked-based search results will likely continue to be the best way to serve users actively looking to buy a product or service. This represents only about 20% of searches done on Google, and it's the only time the company serves up ads. AI, meanwhile, could help the company profit from the 80% of searches for which it does not provide ads. For example, AI could provide Alphabet the opportunity to profit from questions answered using AI, either through brand advertising or a subscription service.\nThe landscape is evolving with AI, but companies will undoubtedly find new ways to profit from its uses and capabilities. Twenty years ago Google was only a search engine that IPO'd with a $23 billion market cap. Today, the company owns two non-search businesses that generate over $30 billion a year in revenue in Google Cloud Services and YouTube, along with its powerful search business. While it's difficult to predict where a stock will be in the next 20 years, Alphabet should be viewed as a core holding that can help power your portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MA.\nAs of 2024-04-15, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $185.66. It's currently trading at a price of $157.77. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 15.02%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$5.94\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n102.56\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n106.93\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n185.66\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $166.94. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 5.49%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.
