        "Text": "Though many of the top asset managers and investors are investing in, or at least open to crypto and Bitcoin, a few remain hesitant to adopt the asset. Most prominent among the anti-Bitcoin camp is legendary investor Warren Buffett.\nBuffett's strategy of investing in solid companies that continuously generate cash and value has been hugely successful. This has allowed his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to sustain itself through market peaks and troughs.\nDon't Miss:\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.\nAbout 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?\nBuffett is notorious for his anti-Bitcoin stance, saying in a 2018 interview with Yahoo! Finance, \"If you buy something like Bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more.\"\nAt the 2022 Berkshire shareholders meeting, Buffett explained his stance on Bitcoin saying, \"If you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn’t take it because what would I do with it? I’d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn’t going to do anything.\"\nBuffett is against Bitcoin and crypto in general. However, this stance does not entirely translate into his company's investments. Berkshire Hathaway is heavily invested in Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings Ltd. The investment was its strongest performer in 2023.\nFounded in 2013, Nu initially offered low-cost bank accounts and personal loans through a format that was much more digitized than its competitors. In 2022, the company launched Nucripto, which allows users to buy and sell more than 15 tokens.\nWhile its crypto business makes up a somewhat small portion of its revenue, it still operates in the crypto sphere, and its customer base continues to grow. It also launched its own cryptocurrency called Nucoin.\nBuffett had invested $500 million in Nu Holdings through a series G funding round before the company went public in December 2021. A few months later, Buffett increased his stake by another $250 million, resulting in a total investment of $750 million.\nThe investment has paid off. Nu is up nearly 50% in 2024 alone and recently set all-time highs. This is also coming off a strong 2023, in which the stock was up nearly 100%.\nThese huge gains could shift Buffett's focus toward crypto. Seeing the profits earned on a crypto-related business could cause the investor to rethink his strategy and stance on crypto. Bitcoin has outperformed most major indices so far in 2024. The token is up nearly 70% in 2024, well above the S&P 500, which is up just over 10% in 2024.\nWith Bitcoin and crypto entering the spotlight again, lots of eyes are on Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett as they contemplate whether to continue investing in Bitcoin-adjacent businesses or even the tokens themselves\nRead Next:\nBitcoin To $100,000?

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), through Berkshire Hathaway, has made a notable addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 50,682,902 shares of Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMK) on March 6, 2024. This transaction saw an increase of 2,183,430 shares at a trade price of $29.26, reflecting a 0.02% trade impact on Berkshire's portfolio. The position in LSXMK now accounts for 0.43% of the firm's holdings, with a significant 15.52% ownership of the traded stock.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with LSXMK.\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), the Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, is a legendary figure in the investment world, often referred to as \"The Oracle of Omaha.\" His investment philosophy, deeply influenced by Benjamin Graham, emphasizes value investingacquiring companies at prices less than their intrinsic value and holding them for the long term. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a textile company, has been transformed under Buffett's leadership into a massive conglomerate with a focus on insurance and other diverse business interests. The firm's top holdings include prominent names such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), American Express Co (NYSE:AXP), and Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), with a total equity of $347.36 billion and a strong inclination towards the technology and financial services sectors.\nLiberty SiriusXM Group, operating primarily through its subsidiary Sirius XM Holdings, is a powerhouse in subscription-based satellite radio services.

The stock's PE Percentage stands at 12.79, indicating profitability, and it boasts a strong GF Score of 81/100, suggesting good potential for outperformance.\nThe recent acquisition of LSXMK shares by Berkshire Hathaway is a strategic move that further solidifies the firm's position in the media-diversified industry. The additional shares represent a modest yet strategic increase in Berkshire's portfolio, which could signal Buffett's confidence in the long-term prospects of Liberty SiriusXM Group. The trade's significance is underscored by the 15.52% stake that Berkshire now holds in the company, making it a substantial investment within the firm's diverse portfolio.\nLiberty SiriusXM Group's current market valuation aligns closely with the GF Value, with a Price to GF Value ratio of 0.93. The stock has experienced a slight decline of 0.03% since the transaction date, yet it has seen a significant increase of 36.94% since its IPO. The year-to-date performance shows a marginal change of 0.07%.

        "Title": "Is Berkshire Hathaway Stock a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Ryan Vanzo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) stock just went on a historic run.\nOver the past 12 months, the stock price has surged by 25%. Over the past five years, meanwhile, shares have more than doubled in value.\nBerkshire's stock price rarely rises this quickly over such a short amount of time. Is the stock still a buy? The answer might surprise you.\nBerkshire is a behemoth stock. After the recent surge, the company now has a market cap of nearly $900 billion.\nA chunk of that value is represented by Berkshire's insurance companies, which generate billions of dollars in investible cash. The vast majority of the company's value, however, is produced through its portfolio of business investments, which includes hundreds of positions across dozens of industries and geographies.\nFor example, Berkshire is the sole owner of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, one of the largest railroad businesses in North America. It fully owns many other well-known businesses including Lubrizol, a special chemicals company, See's Candies, a chocolatier, and Duracell, the battery maker. Berkshire also has a broad investment portfolio of publicly traded securities. Some its more notable positions include Amazon, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Apple.\nWhen approaching a diverse and complex business like this, perhaps the most important number to pay attention to is its price-to-book ratio.\nWhile there are some notable flaws behind book value, this accounting metric can be used to roughly approximate the value of a company's assets. A price-to-book ratio, therefore, gives you a sense of how much the market is willing to pay for a company's asset base. Over the past decade, Berkshire's price-to-book ratio has ranged between 1.0 and 1.6.\nThat 1.0 times book valuation occurred during the pandemic bear market. In hindsight, it was a great buying opportunity.\nThe 1.6 times book valuation, meanwhile, occurred only weeks ago. It was the stock's highest valuation multiple since 2008. Shares have pulled back a touch since then, but make no mistake: Berkshire stock is expensive compared to its past.\nThere's no doubt that right now isn't the best time in history to buy Berkshire stock. But as we'll see, that doesn't mean shares aren't a buy.\nOver the last decade, Berkshire's price-to-book ratio has risen by roughly 15%. That increase in valuation multiple accounts for part of the stock's positive performance, but only a small part.\nOver the same period, Berkshire's stock price has risen by around 230%. That means the bulk of the stock's performance wasn't an increase in the price-to book ratio, but an increase in the underlying metric: book value.\nIn 2015, Berkshire's book value was roughly $250 billion. Today, it is around $560 billion.\nSo yes, the stock's price-to-book ratio has increased, but the stock's performance is no mirage. Berkshire shares have largely risen on improving fundamentals.\nHistorically, there has never been a bad time to buy Berkshire stock. If you bought shares at the height of the dot-com bubble, you'd be sitting on a 1,000% gain. Happen to buy the stock right before the 2008 financial crash? No problem. Today, your investment would be worth nearly four times its original value.\nTo be sure, Berkshire stock may someday become overvalued, but not at a measly 1.5 times book value. Buffett and his investment team have consistently figured out ways to grow shareholder value over the long term, and short-term swings in valuation have never hindered the stock's long-term investment thesis.\nOf course, we all wish we bought Berkshire stock before the recent run. But now is still a wonderful time to take a position in one of the market's longtime winners. Just be sure to hold through the volatility if the valuation multiple normalizes.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

The increase was driven by higher earnings in Insurance-underwriting and Insurance-investment income.\nCosts and expenses increased 20.5% year over year to $321.1 billion, largely due to an increase in expenses at Insurance and Other as well as Railroad, Utilities and Energy.

Earnings in 2023 benefited from relatively low losses from significant catastrophe events during the year and improved underwriting results at GEICO.Railroad, Utilities and Energy operating revenues increased 94.5% year over year to $101.4 billion, attributable to higher freight rail transportation revenues, utility and energy operating revenues and service revenues and other income.Pre-tax earnings of Railroad decreased 14.2% year over year to $6.6 billion.Total revenues at Manufacturing, Service and Retailing increased 0.4% year over year to $168 billion.

Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nBerkshire Hathaway has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\nPerformance of an Industry Player\nBerkshire Hathaway is part of the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry. Over the past month, Palomar (PLMR), a stock from the same industry, has gained 7.9%.
